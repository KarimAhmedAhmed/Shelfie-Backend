   ```

### Configuration

Explain how to configure your project. This could include setting environment variables, configuring the database, or any other necessary configuration steps. Provide detailed instructions for these configurations in your project's documentation.

### Project Structure

Describe the structure of your project's codebase. Explain the purpose of major directories and files. This could include directories for routes, controllers, models, and any other significant components.

### Running the Application

Explain how to run your application locally for development or testing purposes. Provide any necessary commands and steps for running the application, such as:

```bash

Certainly! Here's how you can add a "Testing" section to your project's documentation:

### Testing

Testing is an essential part of the development process to ensure the reliability and functionality of the delivery app. We have provided two commands for running tests and generating test coverage reports.

#### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will run the test suites and provide information about test results.

#### Generating Test Coverage

We also provide the ability to generate test coverage reports to gain insights into the code coverage by tests. To generate the coverage report, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

This command will generate detailed coverage reports that you can review to identify areas of your codebase that may require additional testing.
